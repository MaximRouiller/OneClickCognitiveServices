# One-Click Cognitive Services

When you start using Cognitive Services, you are always asked a bunch of questions on how to deploy them.

Then, in the portal, it becomes complicated to know exactly what you are creating or how to create them.

Here's a simplified version on how to automatically create those services. This is perfect for hackathons and exploratory coding to understand how a service works.

Please note that Cognitive Services may be missing. Pull requests are accepted. ðŸ˜Š

## Custom Vision

This button will create a free Custom Vision service with Prediction and Training Endpoint in the EastUS/WestUS region.

> Custom Vision lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, based on their visual characteristics.

To get started, I recommend reading [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-marouill) as well as trying a tutorial.
